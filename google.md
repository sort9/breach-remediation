# Background

If you suspect your Google account has been breached or hacked, that can have serious implications. Your email, Youtube, payment information, location history, and much more is all available to prying eyes. This remediation guide will give a simple step-by-step process on how to secure your Google account after it has been breached.

## Step 1

Navigate to [google.com](url) and click on your profile picture.

## Step 2

Click on the "Manage your Google Account" button.

## Step 3

On the left hand side of the page, click on where it says "Security."

## Step 4

Scroll down to "How you sign in to Google" and click on where it says Password.

## Step 5

Type in your password to verify yourself and then you will be prompted to enter your new password. I recommend to make sure it is atleast 20 characters with some numbers and special characters.

## IMPORTANT 

This will only sign you out of SOME of the current sessions. To sign out of all current sessions continue to the next steps.

## Step 6

Navigate back to the page where we found "How to sign in to Google" and scroll down to where you see "Your devices." Click on "Manage all devices."

## Step 7

Find a session still currently logged in that you don't recognize and then click on it. You will know that it is still logged in since it will say "Signed out" if not.

## Step 8

Hit "Sign out." If you want to log out of everything then repeat this step for other devices.

# Preventative Measures and other Recommendations
<ol>
  <li>Add 2FA if you have not already (preferably not SMS and instead an app like 2FAS Auth, Bitwarden, Keeper Vault, etc)</li>
  <li>Get a password manager to manage your passwords</li>
  <li>If the Google account breached retained business related information then make sure to notify affected parties</li>
</ol>
